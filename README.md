# me Kalakaua

I code sometimes, learn sometimes, and maybe even build things that work sometimes.  
Got me a sweet diploma so I’m 100% real here.

---

### 🧠 brain currently installing...

- React (slowly understanding why everyone loves it)
- Still figuring out the best way to use JavaScript (it’s a journey)

---

### 🛠️ things I’ve built or broke

- **[about me](https://github.com/KaIakaua/Landing-Page)** – A small page showing a bit of myself, with my social links and the pages I use.  
 

- **[Doom](https://github.com/KaIakaua/GAME)** – Small project to recreate DOOM 1993 using python, not extensive at all.


- **[Horror page](https://kaiakaua.github.io/horror/)** – Non-functional blog-like page with thematic of horror. Just to showcase an idea, no sub pages, only the send message buttons work.
